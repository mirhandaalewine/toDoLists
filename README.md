# toDoLists
## About:
The goal of this project was to create a responsive ToDo list. The list is currently capable of receiving user input and adding it to the ToDo List, as well as removing items based on OnClick events.
## Steps for Use:
In order to use this project, you can fork and clone this repository to make any updates.
## Future Improvements:
In the future, I'd like to add buttons next to each item for item removal. I'd also like to add on-hover changes to indicate which item the user is looking at.
